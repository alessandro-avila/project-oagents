## Architecture

The Todo List Application is developed with C# and is deployed on Azure, ensuring high performance and security in line with the principles of the Well Architected Framework (WAF).

The application is divided into several layers:

A[Presentation Layer]
B[Service Layer]
C[Data Access Layer]
D[Database - Azure SQL]
A --> B
B --> C
C --> D
```
- **Presentation Layer**: This layer includes our web and mobile user interfaces. It communicates with the service layer to perform application operations.
- **Service Layer**: This layer coordinates the applicationâ€™s response to user input. It communicates with the data access layer to retrieve or persist data related to a user's tasks.
- **Data Access Layer**: This layer communicates with the Azure SQL Database to store and retrieve task data. It abstracts the underlying database operations from the rest of the application.
- **Database**: Azure SQL Database is used as the database solution. It provides secure, scalable storage for our application data.
